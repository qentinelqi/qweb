"""
   The purpose of this module is to provide measurement utilities.

   Meas object is either enabled or disabled. When disabled, the calls
   to Meas object are no-ops. The purpose is to be able to leave
   the function calls to the production code and control the
   measurement feature separately.

   The function meas_obj() is
   provided to return the global Meas object.

   Usage:
   from QWeb.internal.meas import meas_obj
   meas_obj().start("outer")
   # some code
   meas_obj().start("inner")
   # some more inner code
   meas_obj().stop()
   meas_obj().stop()
